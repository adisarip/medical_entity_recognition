Medical Entity Recognition
1.	Abstract

2.	Methodologies Tried
We approached the problem of identifying the medical entities in the dataset using the following approaches – A naïve max-word-frequency approach, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and combination of LSTM-CRF.
Among all the methods mentioned above - LSTM-CRF is the state-of-the-art approach for any Named Entity Recognition problem.
Hence we picked it as our final approach.

4.	Datasets Used:
We cleaned up the CADEC dataset set and used it against our model.
